# BCCS - Brick compatible color shelf

## What is this project about?

This project allows the creation and printing of compatible holders for building blocks (like LEGO), making it easier to organize and store things like airbrush or tattoo colors. However, during the project, it actually split into two exciting sub-projects:

    The Bottle Holder
    The Angle Brick

## How did this project come about?

My wife, a passionate tattoo artist, asked if I could print her a tiered shelf for her tattoo colors. After discussing the idea, we identified three key requirements that most existing solutions didn’t quite meet:

    Scalability:S
    The collection of colors keeps growing. It would be great if the shelf could expand easily without having to print everything from scratch.

    Adjustable sizes & modularity:
    Different manufacturers have different bottle sizes. A flexible system that can handle various sizes would be ideal. Additionally, when you have more bottles of a particular size, it would be great to use the space more efficiently. This is where a modular system comes in handy.

    Quick to print:
    Let's be honest—many existing solutions take forever to print due to the time needed for the shelf or the underlying structure. But why not use something we already have lying around in abundance, or can get cheaply from third-party suppliers? In this solution, only the actual holders are printed, while the rest is built with building blocks.

## What about the angle bricks?

We’ve all been there: after printing the first few parts, you think, “Hey, this would be even cooler if...”. In this case, the idea was to have angled shelves. Instead of printing new shelves with slanted bases (which I actually tested once), I thought, why not use the formulas I already had for the base calculations to print a brick that serves as an adapter? And voilà, the angle brick was born!
